        <p>The book flies up and smacks the man in the face, and he stumbles back in shock. It's too late though. The girl in the yellow lab coat turns to you, and you suddenly do not recognize her face. There is no way that was the same, bubbly girl as before. You don't know what it is, but somehow, she doesn't quite look human anymore.</p>
        <p>
        The girl snaps her fingers, and before you know it, you get the wind knocked over you and you fall to the ground. A different girl, this one short with long curly hair is suddenly standing over you. She looks pleased as she walks away from your sorry self, leaving you to have to deal with the creature in yellow.
        </p>
        <p>
        "You fool," the creature hisses, her smile returning but this time it makes your stomach sink. "Next time, you'll learn to understand who is in charge here."
        </p>
        <p>
        Her face is the last thing you see before you black out.
