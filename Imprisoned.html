        <p>"How disappointing. Your loss."</p>
        
        <p>The figure on the other side of the door slides a cover over the slit in the door, leaving you to be consumed by the darkness. Who knows if you'll ever see the light of day again. After sitting back down in the darkness for some amount of time, you drift back off to sleep, knowing you will probably never leave this stuffy little jail cell again.</p>
