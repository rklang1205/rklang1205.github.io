        <p>You close your eyes, and when you open them, you're back at your house. It's dark out, and everything feels off. You don't remember how you originally ended up in that jail cell, but you have an odd feeling it's about to happen again. You sneak out the back door of your house and hop the fence, hiding in the dark in your neighbors yard.</p>
        <p>
        From the other side of the fence, commotion breaks out. You are clearly not where they expected you to be, and they are furious that they lost track of you. You can hear the voice of the girl in yellow barking orders, but her voice is no longer what you remember. Her rage ripples through the neighborhood, and you think you hear her yelling setting off a car alarm a few blocks away. Listening to her fury grow gives you shivers as you remember how sweet she seemed only moments ago, when you were in her jail cell in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            As long as they cannot find you, you remain safe, but the threat isn't over yet. With newfound powers, but nowhere to go, what will you do?
