        <p>Before you can be briefed or talked to, you close your eyes, and you open them to find yourself in a tropical rainforest. And a gigantic dinosaur is staring you down.</p>

            You look around, and realize you are standing next to a nest of dinosaur eggs. The mother dinosaur is furious that you managed to get so close to it without her noticing, thanks to your newfound, and clumsy, time travel powers. She is getting ready to charge, you better move fast! But NOBODY would believe that you went to the past, should you find a way to prove yourself?
