        <p>You sit still on the floor and wait for something to happen. You think you can hear quiet mumbling from the other side of the door, and you briefly watch shadows pass by the slit in the window, but you can't get any actual information. There is at least a few voices coming from the other side of the door. It doesn't seem that they know you're awake yet.</p>
