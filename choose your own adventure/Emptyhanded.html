        <p>You weren't about to stick around and deal with that dinosaur, so you close your eyes and get out of there as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>
            You come back to find the intimidating man trying desperately to comfort the girl in yellow, who had angry tears running down her face. Apparently your disappearance was NOT what she was looking for. She notices your return, and as she storms over to you, something transforms in her face. That cheery, colorful girl in yellow is gone.

        "What, so you just decided to leave and come back? You think you can do that whenever you want? No. You agreed to this, and clearly this little excursion means that we cannot trust you anymore. You will remain in this cell with security watching you 24/7. You could've been a team player and worked along side us as a collegue. But clearly we must do things the hard way."

        The girl in yellow snapped her fingers, and the other girl with curly hair quickly has your arms pinned behind your back. You did not expect her to be so strong, but with very little effort, you fall under her control. She handcuffs you and throws you back into the jail cell, where she keeps watch over you as the door closes and the darkness returns. This probably could've turned out better..
