        <p>"Great Choice!" she squeals, and she immediately jabs you with a needle, smile still on her face. Her face is the last thing you see before you black out.</p>

        When you wake up again, the door is fully open, and you see various people working at desks and on computers. The girl in the yellow lab coat is excitedly chatting with a very tall and intimidating looking man who you can only assume is the man that was speaking to you before.

        You remember what you told the girl before you blacked out. Telekinesis, huh? There is a big, wordy looking book on the table next to the strange girl and scary looking man. Directing all of your focus onto the book, it starts to float. The young woman notices, and looks elated as she smiles at you from across the room. You're not positive, but you think the man's frown has lessened a bit, too.
